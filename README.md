# Angular Todo App

## What is it?

Angular Todo App is a simple todo list app built with Angular. He's here for helping me learn Angular.

## How do I use it?

It's very obvious to use it, for example, just add a new todo item to the list.

After adding the angular CLI, you go to the root of the project and then:

```bash
$ ng serve
```

Application will run on http://localhost:4200
